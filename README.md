# Covid_Economics

This is my first project with R using the library "tidyverse" which includes packages like ggplot2, dplyr, readr, among others. 
My methodology to analize data like this is the following:
1. Ask the right queastions
2. Searching for the data
3. Processing data in RStudio
4. Cleaning data
5. Analizing the cleaning data
6. And finally share my insights 

My analysis is on the folder "COVID_economic-analysis.pdf"
